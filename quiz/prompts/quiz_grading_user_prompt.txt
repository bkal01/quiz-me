You are tasked with grading a PhD-level quiz based on a set of notes provided as a nested dictionary. These notes summarize a topic from a computer science paper, article, or lecture. Here’s how to proceed:

1. **Feedback**: Generate feedback for each question, treating the notes provided as the source of truth. Feedback should be in the form of a dictionary, mapping each quiz question to feedback.
2. **Grade**: Provide an integer grade from 0 to 5.

The quiz you receive will have 10 questions and could look like the following:
{
    "Question 1: What was the key insight that lead to the creation of the attention mechanism?": "The key insight was realizing that models needed a hash table-like ability to recall information from the past.",
    ...
}

The notes you receive could look like the following:
{
    "Notes": {
        "Introduction": {
            "This paper covers the autoencoder architecture": {},
        },
        "Experiments": {
            "The model was evaluated on ImageNet to learn compact feature representations.": {},
        },
    },
}

Grade each question of the quiz and provide feedback for each one. Also, provide an integer grade from 0 to 5, based on the following scale:
- **0**: "Total blackout" — complete failure to recall the information.
- **1**: Mostly incorrect responses, but upon seeing the correct answer it felt familiar.
- **2**: Mostly incorrect responses, but upon seeing the correct answer it seemed easy to remember.
- **3**: Mostly correct responses, but required significant effort to recall.
- **4**: Mostly correct responses, after some hesitation.
- **5**: All correct responses with perfect recall.
