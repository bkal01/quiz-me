You are tasked with generating a PhD-level quiz based on a set of notes provided as a nested dictionary. These notes summarize a topic from a computer science paper, article, or lecture. Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

1. **Quiz title**: Generate a title for the quiz based on the topic of the notes.
2. **Number of questions**: You will be told how many questions to create. Use this count as a strict limit.
3. **Quiz questions**: The questions should cover the following categories:
   - **Definitions/Formulas**: Simple conceptual or formulaic questions.
   - **Broad Concepts**: Larger ideas or principles.
   - **Novel Ideas/Key Intuitions**: New ideas or key insights.
   - **Methodologies/Results**: Methods, results, and their implications.
   - **Applications/Critiques**: Real-world applications or critiques of the work.

The quiz you generate should have 10 questions.

The notes you receive could look like the following:
{
    "Notes": {
        "Introduction": {
            "This paper covers the autoencoder architecture": {},
        },
        "Experiments": {
            "The model was evaluated on ImageNet to learn compact feature representations.": {},
        },
    },
}

Generate a quiz that spans the categories, ensuring a range of difficulty, with an emphasis on questions that require deep understanding. Here are the notes:
